`\(\hspace{2cm}\)`

- Revisit **Card and Krueger (1993)** minimum wage and employment study comparing NJ and PA.

- 2 units and 2 time periods.

- 1 treated unit (T), which receives treatment in the second period. 

- 1 control unit (C), which is never treated.

# .center.pull[Difference-in-Differences]

- Building upon **Angrist &amp; Pischke (2008, p. 228)** we can think of the simple 2x2 DiD as a fixed effects estimator.

- Potential Outcomes 
  - `\(Y_{i, t}^0\)` = value of dependent variable for unit `\(i\)` in period `\(t\)` without treatment.
  - `\(Y_{i, t}^1\)` = value of dependent variable for unit `\(i\)` in period `\(t\)` with treatment.
  
- The expected outcome is a *linear function* of unit and time fixed effects:
`$$E[{Y_{i, t}^0}] =\alpha_i + \alpha_t$$`
`$$E[{Y_{i, t}^1}] =\alpha_i + \alpha_t + \color{maroon}{\delta} D_{st}$$`
- The goal of DiD is to get an *unbiased estimate* of the treatment effect `\(\color{maroon}{\delta}\)`.


---
# .center.pull[Difference-in-Differences]

- Difference in expectations for the *control* unit between times t = 1 and t = 0:
`$$\begin{align*} E[Y_{C, 1}^0] &amp; = \alpha_1 + \alpha_C \\ E[Y_{C, 0}^0] &amp; = \alpha_0 + \alpha_C  \\ E[Y_{C, 1}^0] - E[Y_{C, 0}^0] &amp; = \alpha_1 - \alpha_0 \end{align*}$$`
 
- Now do the same thing for the *treated* unit:
   `$$\begin{align*} E[Y_{T, 1}^1] &amp; = \alpha_1 + \alpha_T + \color{maroon}{\delta} \\ E[Y_{T, 0}^1] &amp; = \alpha_0 + \alpha_T  \\ E[Y_{T, 1}^1] - E[Y_{T, 0}^1] &amp; = \alpha_1 - \alpha_0 + \color{maroon}{\delta} \end{align*}$$`
- If we assume the linear structure of DiD, then unbiased estimate of `\(\color{maroon}{\delta}\)` is:

`$$\color{maroon}{\delta} =
    \begin{align*} &amp; \left( E[Y_{T, 1}^1] - E[Y_{T, 0}^1] \right) - \left( E[Y_{C, 1}^0] - E[Y_{C, 0}^0] \right) \end{align*}$$`

&lt;img src="DID_files/figure-html/d2-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# .center.pull[Regression DiD]

The DiD can be estimated through linear regression of the form:

`$$\tag{1} y_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 TREAT_i + \beta_2 POST_t + \color{maroon}{\delta} (TREAT_i \cdot POST_t) + \epsilon_{it}$$`

The coefficients from the regression estimate in (1) recover the same parameters as the two-way differencing performed above:
`$$\begin{align*} 
    \alpha &amp;= E[y_{it} | i = C, t = 0] = \alpha_0 + \alpha_C \\
    \\
    \beta_1 &amp;= E[y_{it} | i = T, t = 0] - E[y_{it} | i = C, t= 0] \\ 
    &amp;= (\alpha_0 + \alpha_T) - (\alpha_0 + \alpha_C) = \alpha_T - \alpha_C \\
    \\
    \beta_2 &amp;= E[y_{it} | i = C, t = 1] - E[y_{it} | i = C, t = 0] \\ 
    &amp;= (\alpha_1 + \alpha_C) - (\alpha_0 + \alpha_C) = \alpha_1 - \alpha_0 \\
    \\
    \color{maroon}{\delta} &amp;= \left(E[y_{it} | i = T, t = 1] - E[y_{it} | i = T, t = 0] \right) - \\
    &amp;\hspace{.5cm} \left(E[y_{it} | i = C, t = 1] - E[y_{it} | i = C t = 0] \right) = \delta
    \end{align*}$$`

# .center.pull[TWFE DiD]

- Regression DiD provides both estimates of `\(\color{maroon}{\delta}\)` and standard errors for the estimates.

- **Angrist &amp; Pischke (2008)**:
  - "It's also easy to add additional (units) or periods to the regression setup... [and] it's easy to add additional covariates."

- &lt;span style="color:maroon"&gt; Two-way fixed effects estimator &lt;span&gt;:
`$$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \color{maroon}{\delta^{DD}} D_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$$`

  - `\(\alpha_i\)` and `\(\alpha_t\)` are unit and time fixed effects, `\(D_{it}\)` is the unit-time indicator for treatment.
  
  - `\(TREAT_i\)` and `\(POST_t\)` now subsumed by the fixed effects.
  
  - Can be easily modified to include covariate matrix `\(X_{it}\)`, time trends, dynamic treatment effects estimation, etc. 

---
# .center.pull[Where TWFE Goes Wrong]

- Recent development in econometrics on the issues with TWFE DiD with "staggered treatment timing" (**de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille (2020), Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021), Goodman-Bacon (2021), Sun and Abraham (2021)**)

  - Different units receive treatment at different periods in time.
  
- Staggered DiD is commonly used. It helps to increase the amount of cross-sectional variation if done correctly. 

- What really happened behind the scenes: 
  
  - &lt;span style="color:maroon"&gt; `\(\color{maroon}{\delta^{DD}}\)` with staggered treatment timing is a weighted average of many different treatment effects &lt;span&gt;. 
  
  - The weights are sometimes negative and non-intuitive.
  
  - Before 2018, people knew little about how TWFE measures when treatment timing varies, how it compares means across groups, or why different specifications change estimates.
  
---
# .center.pull[Bias with TWFE - Goodman-Bacon (2021)]

- **Goodman-Bacon (2021)** provides a clear graphical intuition for the bias. Assume three treatment groups - never treated units (U), early treated units (k), and later treated units (l).

&lt;img src="DID_files/figure-html/d3-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# .center.pull[Bias with TWFE - Goodman-Bacon (2021)]

- **Goodman-Bacon (2021)** shows that we can form four different 2x2 groups in this setting, where the effect can be estimated using the simple regression DiD in each group:

&lt;img src="DID_files/figure-html/d4-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# .center.pull[Bias with TWFE - Goodman-Bacon (2021)]

- Some important Insights

  - `\(\color{maroon}{\delta^{DD}}\)` is just the *weighted average* of the four 2x2 treatment effects. The weights are a function of the *size of the sub-sample, relative size of treatment and control units, and the timing of treatment in the sub-sample*.
  
  - Already-treated units act as controls even though they are treated.
  
  - Given the weighting function, panel length alone can change the DiD estimates substantially, even when each `\(\color{maroon}{\delta^{DD}}\)` does not change.
  
  - Groups treated closer to middle of panel receive higher weights than those treated earlier or later.
  
---
# .center.pull[Simulation Exercise]

- Can show how easily `\(\color{maroon}{\delta^{DD}}\)` goes wrong through a simulation exercise.

- Consider two sets of DiD estimates - one where the treatment occurs in one period, and one where the treatment is staggered.

- The data generating process (DGP) is linear: `\(y_{it} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \color{maroon}{\delta_{it}} + \epsilon_{it}\)`.
  - `\(\alpha_i, \alpha_t \sim N(0, 1)\)`
  - `\(\epsilon_{i, t} \sim N\left(0, \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\right)\)`
  
- We will consider two different treatment assignment set ups for `\(\color{maroon}{\delta_{it}}\)`.

---
# .center.pull[Simulation 1 - 1 Period Treatment]

- There are 20 states `\(s\)`, and 200 units `\(i\)` randomly drawn from the 20 states.

- Data covers years 1990 to 2010, and half the states receive "treatment" in 2000. 

- For every unit incorporated in a treated state, we pull a unit-specific treatment effect from `\(\mu_i \sim N(0.3, (1/5)^2)\)`.

- Treatment effects here are trend breaks rather than unit shifts: the accumulated treatment effect `\(\color{maroon}{\delta_{it}}\)` is `\(\mu_i \times (year - 1995 + 1)\)` for years after 2000. 

- We then estimate the average treatment effect as `\(\color{maroon}{\hat{\delta}}\)` from:

`$$y_{it} = \hat{\alpha_i} + \hat{\alpha_t} + \color{maroon}{\hat{\delta}} D_{it}$$`

- Simulate this data 500 times and plot the distribution of estimates `\(\color{maroon}{\hat{\delta}}\)` and the true effect (red line).

---
# .center.pull[Simulation 1 - 1 Period Treatment]

&lt;img src="DID_files/figure-html/d5-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# .center.pull[Simulation 2 - Staggered Treatment]

- Run similar analysis with staggered treatment. 

- The 20 states are randomly assigned into four treatment cohorts of size 50 depending on year of treatment assignment (1994, 1998, 2002, and 2004)

- DGP is identical, except that now `\(\color{maroon}{\delta_{it}}\)` is equal to `\(\mu_i \times (year - \tau_g + 1)\)` where `\(\tau_g\)` is the treatment assignment year. 

- Again, we estimate this data 500 times and plot the distribution of estimates `\(\color{maroon}{\hat{\delta}}\)` and the true effect (red line).

---
# .center.pull[Simulation 2 - Staggered Treatment]

&lt;img src="DID_files/figure-html/d6-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# .center.pull[Simulation 2 - Staggered Treatment]

- &lt;span style="color:maroon"&gt;  Main problem - we use *early treated units* as controls for later treated units, which violates the *parallel trends assumption*! &lt;span&gt; 

- When the treatment effect is "dynamic", i.e. takes more than one period to be incorporated into your dependent variable, you are *subtracting* the treatment effects from prior treated units from the estimate of future control units. 

- This biases your estimates towards zero when all the treatment effects are the same. 

---
# .center.pull[Another Simulation]

- Can we actually get estimates for `\(\color{maroon}{\delta}\)` that are of the *wrong sign*? Yes, if treatment effects for early treated units are larger (in absolute magnitude) than the treatment effects on later treated units. 

- Let's simulate another example in which units are randomly assigned to one of 20 states. The 20 states are randomly assigned into one of 5 treatment groups `\(G_g\)` based on treatment being initiated in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2009. 

- All treated units incorporated in a state in treatment group `\(G_g\)` receive a treatment effect `\(\delta_i \sim N(\delta_g, .2^2)\)`.

- The treatment effect is cumulative or dynamic - `\(\delta_{it} = \delta_i \times (year - G_g)\)`.

---
# .center.pull[Another Simulation]

- The average treatment effect multiple decreases over time:

`\(\hspace{2cm}\)`

&lt;tbody&gt;

   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 1993 &lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 1997 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 0.4 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 2001 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 0.3 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 2005 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 0.2 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 2009 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt; 0.1 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# .center.pull[Another Simulation]

- First let's look at the distribution of `\(\color{maroon}{\delta^{DD}}\)` using TWFE estimation with this simulated sample:

# .center.pull[Callaway &amp; Sant'Anna]

- Inverse propensity weighted (IPW) long-difference in cohort-specific average treatment effects between treated and untreated units for a given treatment cohort. 

`$$\begin{equation} ATT(g, t) = \mathbb{E} \left[\left( \frac{G_g}{\mathbb{E}[G_g]} - \frac{\frac{p_g(X)C}{1 - p_g(X)}}{\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{p_g(X)C}{1 - p_g(X)} \right]} \right) \left(Y_t - T_{g - 1}\right)\right] \end{equation}$$`


- Without covariates, as in the simulated example here, it calculates the simple long difference between all treated units `\(i\)` in relative year `\(k\)` with all potential control units that have not yet been treated by year `\(k\)`.

---
# .center.pull[Callaway &amp; Sant'Anna]

&lt;img src="DID_files/figure-html/d11-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# .center.pull[Abraham and Sun]

- A relatively straightforward extension of the standard event-study TWFE model:

`$$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \sum_e \sum_{l \neq -1} \delta_{el}(1\{E_i = e\} \cdot D_{it}^l) + \epsilon_{it}$$`

- You saturate the relative time indicators (i.e. t = -2, -1, ...) with indicators for the treatment initiation year group, and aggregate to overall aggregate relative time indicators by cohort size.

- In the case of no covariates, this gives you the same estimate as Callaway &amp; Sant'Anna if you *fully saturate* the model with time indicators (leaving only two relative year identifiers missing).

- The authors don't claim that it can be used with covariates, but it seemingly follows if we think it is okay with normal TWFE DiD.

&lt;img src="DID_files/figure-html/d12-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# .center.pull[Model Comparison]

- **Callaway &amp; Sant'Anna**
  
  - Can be *very* flexible in determining which control units to consider, including never-treated and not-yet-treated. 
  - Has a more flexible functional form as well (easier to adjust for pre-treatment covariates).
  - *Doubly robust* estimation: combine propensity score and linear regression so that we will get unbiased estimate if either model specification is correct.

- **Abraham &amp; Sun** 
  
  - Very similar to regular TWFE OLS and hence easy to explain. 
  - Control units are all units not treated within the data sample. If most of your units are treated by the end (or all), this can make control units very non-representative and restricted.

- Without covariates, **Callaway &amp; Sant'Anna** and **Abraham &amp; Sun** yield same results. 

---
# .center.pull[What Are The Best Practices?]

- It is still safe to use TWFE DiD when:  
  - there is only a **single treatment period**; 
  - the treatment effects are **homogeneous**. 

- When there are multiple time periods, we should consider to: 
  - plot the **treatment timing across cohorts**; 
  - decompose the TWFE estimator with **Bacon-decomposition**. 

- When using event-study specification, we should **avoid binning relative-time periods** unless we have reasons to believe homogeneous effects apply in the relative-time periods within a bin.

---

# .center.pull[Plot Treatment Timing Across Cohort]
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;img src="Plot treatment timing across cohorts.png", height = "33%", width = "33%"&gt;

---
# .center.pull[What Are The Best Practices?]

- If there is justifiable concern for bias, we should apply at least one of the **alternative estimators**.
  - *Callaway &amp; Sant'Anna, Abraham and Sun, de Chaisemartin-D'Haultfoeuille, etc.*

- When using the alternative estimators, we should justify their choice of **clean comparison groups** (not-yet treated, last treated, or never treated) and articulate why the parallel-trends assumption is likely to apply.

- Regardless of the estimators used, static DiD estimates should be accompanied by **event-study estimates**. 

- It is good practice to use more than one alternative estimators and compare their estimates. However, it is really uncessary to include all the available estimators...

---
# .center.pull[Takeaways]

- TWFE estimator is a power tool and we should still use it for DiD when appropriate.

- However, we should make sure we understand what we're doing. DiD is a **comparison of means** and at a minimum we should know which means we're comparing. 

- Multiple new methods have been proposed, all of which ensure that you **aren't using prior treated units as controls**. 

- You should probably tailor your selection of method to your **data structure**: they use and discard different amount of control units and depending on your setting this might matter. 

- You don't have to use all the new methods in your project!
